# Ekman Spiral – DGPD Project

This repository contains Maple worksheets used in the DGPD course project
**“The Ekman Spiral”** at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The code was used to:
- Define a parametric model of an Ekman-inspired spiral
- Compute speed, curvature, torsion, and Frenet–Serret frames
- Generate figures used in the final report
- Construct a swept ribbon surface using Cosserat sweeping

## Structure
- `maple/` – Maple worksheets (.mw) for curve modeling, analysis, and sweeping

## Notes
The repository is provided for transparency and reproducibility.
All results are fully described and interpreted in the report.
